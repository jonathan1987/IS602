The final_Project.py works as follows:
- First input your giantbomb.com api key and the exact name of a video game to search
- To get the users who reviewed a video game, first you have to extract the uniuque ID of the game.
- Using that ID, you have to extract all releases of the game (DLC/version/Released in what country).
- Extract each unique release ID to get the reviews and extract the username.
- Final_project2.py is or was meant to create a social network graph of each user and see who is following or follows who based
- on the game they reviewed

-Unfortunately unlike Twitter or Facebook, Giantbomb.com's API doesn't include user data and is only for games, reviews, videos etc
